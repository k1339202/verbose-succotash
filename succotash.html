      <h2>Verbose Succotash:</h2>
      <p class="definiton" style="text-indent: 0rem;">[noun (humorous)] (vur-BOHS SUH-kuh-tash)</p>
      <p class="definiton">A overly wordy description of Succotash, a North American corn dish. The name succotash is derived from the Narragansett word sahquttahhash, which means "broken corn kernels"</p>
      <p class="definiton" style="text-align: center;">---------</p>
      <p class="definiton">Succotash has a long history. It is believed to have been an invention of indigenous peoples in what is now known as New England, though English soldier and explorer Jonathan Carver attributed it to numerous tribes of eastern North America:</p>
      <p class="definiton">One dish however, which answers nearly the same purpose as bread, is in use among the Ottagaumies, the Saukies, and the more eastern nations, where Indian corn grows, which is not only much esteemed by them, but it is reckoned extremely palatable by all the Europeans who enter their dominions. This is composed of their unripe corn as before described, and beans in the same state, boiled together with bears flesh, the fat of which moistens the pulse, and renders it beyond comparison delicious. They call this food Succatosh.</p>
      <p class="definiton">British colonists adapted the dish as a stew in the 17th century. Composed of ingredients unknown in Europe at the time, it gradually became a standard meal in the cuisine of New England and is a traditional dish of many Thanksgiving celebrations in the region,[10] as well as in Pennsylvania and other states.</p>
      <p class="definiton">Because of the relatively inexpensive and more readily available ingredients, the dish was popular during the Great Depression in the United States. It was sometimes cooked in a casserole form, often with a light pie crust on top as in a traditional pot pie.</p>
      <p class="definiton">After the abolition of slavery in the United States, freed slaves in the American South returned to Africa and introduced the dish to the region.</p>
